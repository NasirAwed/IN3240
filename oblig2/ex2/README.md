# Exercise 2

Using **equivalence partitions** and **boundary value analysis**.

## 2.1 (i and ii)

Equivalence partitions (VALID or implicitly invalid):

* Months
  * P1 = (infty, 0]
  * P2 = [1, 12] VALID
  * P3 = [13, 99]
  * P4 = [100, infty)
* days
  * P1 = (infty, 0]
  * P2 = [1, 31] VALID
  * P3 = [32, 99]
  * P4 = [100, infty)

The boundary values are the numbers at each closed end of the intervals (i.e. the numbers next to '[' and ']').

## 2.2

Failure to show informative note:
When clicking the button and no values are specified.

Inconsistent fonts:
Clicking with no values differ when doing it after just starting the program or after viewing a zodiac description.

Letters or other symbols:

Sagittarius Boundary Value Analysis:
Sagittarius end (12-21) is "unvalid date"
