## Test levels and test types

Test levels are a grouping of different test activities corresponding to the different levels of development.
Hence, test levels correspond to to different objectives and fit in at different places in the development cycle, and match different test types.
Test levels are important to define because several diciplines are involved in development.

A common simplified version of the V-model corresponds to the following test levels:
* Unit testing (Component testing)
  * Tests: Modules, programs, objects, classes, etc
* Integration testing
  * Tests interfaces (components, OS, hardware, filesystem, etc)
* System testing
  * Tests the whole system
* Acceptance testing
  * Validation against user needs

Other development processes have different test levels than this.
One could be using a different variation of the V-model, or maybe some iterative development process, or something else.
Whatever process one uses, developing tests should be done at the corresponding level in the dev process.

More details can be expanded for each of these levels.
As an example, acceptance testing may comprise of: Operational acceptance test, compliance acceptance test, alpha testing, beta testing.
