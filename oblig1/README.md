Task 0
* Tried to do option 3, but the process was like hell on earth
  * The invasive system of sonarcloud wants way to many permissions
  * One has to download proprietary buildwrapper and scanner
  * Running the buildwrapper fails with `LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded`
  * Hardly worth the suffering
